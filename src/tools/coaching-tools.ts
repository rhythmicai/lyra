Based on this data, write a personal, encouraging coaching letter to ${username}. Structure it as follows:

1. **Opening**: Warm greeting acknowledging their efforts and contributions
2. **Strengths Recognition**: Highlight 2-3 specific strengths based on the data (including performance practices if applicable)
3. **Growth Opportunities**: Identify 3-4 specific areas for improvement with concrete suggestions, including:
   - Performance optimization opportunities (N+1 queries, blocking operations, memory management)
   - Code quality improvements
   - Testing and documentation practices
4. **Performance Focus**: If performance issues are detected, provide specific guidance on:
   - Database optimization techniques
   - Async/await best practices
   - Memory management strategies
   - Frontend performance optimization
5. **Skill Development Plan**: Provide a prioritized 30/60/90 day plan for skill improvement
6. **Resources & Next Steps**: Suggest specific resources, practices, or habits to adopt
7. **Closing**: Encouraging message about their potential and growth trajectory

Write in a supportive, peer-to-peer tone. Be specific with examples from their data, but focus on growth and improvement rather than criticism. 
Include practical tips they can implement immediately. Make it personal and actionable.`;

## Remember

Growth is a journey, not a destination. Every PR, every code review, and every refactoring is an opportunity to improve. The fact that you're seeking feedback shows you're already on the right path.

Keep coding, keep learning, and keep pushing yourself to new heights! ðŸš€
